# Schema

Entity attributes are specified by using a schemas.

Closely mirror the capabilities of DynamoDB-Toolbox. You can find out more on which types are available in the [Attributes section](/docs/schemas-and-attributes).

Schemas are composable, re-use them accross entities.

:::info

Schemas are a standalone feature of DynamoDB-Toolbox. You can use them on their own to validate or format data for instance. We have plan to outsource them in their own library someday.
